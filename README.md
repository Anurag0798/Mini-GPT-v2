# Mini-GPT-v2

Welcome to Mini-GPT-v2! This project provides a minimal setup for exploring conversational AI using a Jupyter notebook. Perfect for those looking to experiment with GPT-based models in a straightforward manner.

---

## Introduction

Mini-GPT-v2 is a simple project designed to offer a hands-on experience with a conversational AI model. With just two files, this setup is ideal for educational purposes and initial experimentation with GPT-based models.

---

## Files

- data.txt: Modify the sample data on which model will be trained on.
- mini_gpt.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook where the magic happens. This file includes the implementation and exploration of the model.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring Mini-GPT-v2, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anurag0798/Mini-GPT-v2.git
   
   cd Mini-GPT-v2
   ```
2. Setup Environment: Ensure you have Jupyter installed. You can install it via pip if needed:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Notebook: Launch Jupyter and open mini_gpt.ipynb:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook mini_gpt.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Running the Notebook: Execute the notebook cells in order to set up the environment, load data from data.txt, and interact with the model.

- Experimentation: Modify cells to tweak model parameters, change input data, and test different configurations.

> **Tip:** Use data.txt to experiment and train the model with different conversation prompts or datasets for varied results.
